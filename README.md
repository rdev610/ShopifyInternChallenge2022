## ABOUT 
This is a web application that tracks the inventory for a logistics company.

To use the application the user must sign-up/login first. 

Once logged in the user can add, delete, read, and  update the products in the application. The user can also press a button that will export the product data into a CSV file.  

## To run the app locally
1). Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you do not already have Visual Studio Code.

3). Install a version of Python 3. 
Options include:
